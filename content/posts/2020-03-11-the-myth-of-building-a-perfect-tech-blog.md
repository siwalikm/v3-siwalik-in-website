> After spending months procrastinating on building a perfect tech blog, I finally let go of all my anxiety and decided to write this article about my learnings behind building a blog.

Since my very first interaction with a computer, blogs posts have been an integral part of my learning. Along the way, I had published a few blog posts myself and also created a maintained a tech-blog back in the day (when Blogspot was a thing). But despite that when I saw down to build a blog for me last year, I felt completely lost.

I grew up looking at incredible and often unbelievable web-designs on awwwards.com (which in a way inspired me to pick up frontend), so when it came to my blog, I wanted it to stand out in all possible ways.

## Chasing Rainbows

I knew I wanted to build something outstanding, something that would help me deliver a moment of wow to my readers and showcase my skills as a frontend person. So I went to my journal and started figuring out my secret herbs and spices.

A few months later, I had a blog which was still no way near completion. To top that, now and then I would see something beautiful online and come back to my drawing board and re-iterate on my blog in terms of tech and UI, thanks to my monkey mind.

Clearly I didn’t know what I was looking for and soon enough I started procrastinating and pushing this project for later.

## Finding the Purpose

Then a couple of weeks later I sat down one evening to retrospect things not going on as planned in my life (I try to do this few time every month). And it suddenly struck me. I thought about why I wanted to create a blog in the first place and what is that I’m doing wrong.

I have always wanted to document my tech journey and learn in public and share it as I grow. But somewhere along the line, I completely forgot about the purpose and focussed on the not so important things.

If you’ve ever told yourself you’ll start that podcast once you have that mic or finally start running once you buy a running shoe, I was at that exact place.

So, the next weekend I decided to completely scrap the website I spent months on, fork a minimal opensource project from Github and start freaking writing.

> Make it work, then make it better.

As this saying goes, I plan to incrementally tweak things over time and still focus on spending most of the time on the content.

## Conclusion

I don’t know if a perfect tech blog exists. But If it does, it must be its contents. Ego is the enemy folks! Let go of your inhibitions and focus on shipping the smallest chunk of work which will provide value to your target audience. That’s it.
