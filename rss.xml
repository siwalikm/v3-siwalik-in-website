From exciting, and adventurous to anxious and uncertain. It was a time when I learned to live with a newfound sense of patience, and also gained an appreciation for the importance of keeping my goals realistic.
Or at least tried to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve been journalling about my new year’s visions and values for three years now in my journal and along with that comes the customary yearly reflection. Reflecting helps me remind myself that although 2022 was an exciting time filled with adventure and anticipation, it was also a time when I made mistakes, learned from them, and grew as an individual.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year I decided to type out those scribbles and share it in this blog with you. So let’s jump right in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;working-on-my-mental-health&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#working-on-my-mental-health&quot; aria-label=&quot;working on my mental health permalink&quot; class=&quot;anchor before&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; focusable=&quot;false&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Working on My Mental Health&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The past year has been an exciting and transformative one. I’ve always been interested in mental health, but this year, I really made an effort to focus on my well-being.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I set one goal for myself: to achieve the best version of mental health possible and meditate daily. Although I didn’t stick to my streak (the highest streak was 21 days), I did feel significant improvement in my mindfulness. I felt more aware of my mind and thoughts, and that alone made me feel so much more in control and happier.
Another thing that’s changed is how I see life—for better or worse! I discovered stoicism as a philosophy, which changed how I see the world around me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I read “On the Shortness of Life” by Seneca and found it incredible. I also started reading “Guide to Good Life”, a book by William B. Irvine, one of my favourite authors on this topic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;jump-on-to-the-fitness-train&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#jump-on-to-the-fitness-train&quot; aria-label=&quot;jump on to the fitness train permalink&quot; class=&quot;anchor before&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; focusable=&quot;false&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Jump on to the Fitness Train&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m not sure how many of you are familiar with the term “New Year’s resolution,” but I am here to tell you that it’s a lot like a gym membership.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s something you’re supposed to do, but you never actually do it. It’s something that makes your life better, but you don’t believe it will. And when it comes down to it, it’s just another thing in your list of things to do—and we all know how good we are at checking off those boxes!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But this year was different. This year, I finally decided enough was enough: it was time to make some changes in my life and start taking care of myself—and that meant joining a gym.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I took a gym membership, and I started with a reasonable goal of burning 10 kilos. I hit 8 kilos… not a success. But it was fun, and I learned a lot about fitness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For one thing, it makes me feel good—like a secret agent or something. It makes me feel like I’m doing something important for myself, something that will make me stronger in ways that matter more than just my physical appearance.
And those are the important things: feeling good about yourself, feeling capable of doing things you didn’t think you could do before (or at least trying them), and doing those things with other people who are also trying new things!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I failed my language learning goals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I’m okay with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I mean, I’m not going to lie and say that it didn’t sting a little bit to lose my streak on Duolingo after I’d worked so hard to build it up, but in the end, it’s just a number on a screen. And that’s not even the whole story. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The real reason why I’m failing this resolution is that Berlin is so culturally diverse that I can get by with just English—and that means I’m not motivated to learn German.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what do we do now? Do we throw in the towel and say “oh well” and move on? Of course not! If anything, this experience has taught me that even if you don’t follow through with your resolution, it doesn’t mean your life is over or that you’re a failure. It just means you’re human. And sometimes being human means failing at things—but that doesn’t mean those things aren’t worth trying again (2023, I’m looking at you)!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m going to start by saying something I don’t think I’ve said before: in 2022, I went on more dates than in any other year of my life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it’s not like I’m super-social or anything—I’m not even sure that’s accurate. But when you’re single, sometimes you just want to meet someone new and see where things go. And when you’re single and pursuing your career in a relatively new city and Country, sometimes your social life is kind of limited to the late evenings after work or the weekends. And if you have other hobbies like me, you’re up for luck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So this year, to get over my dating woes and meet more people (and hopefully find “the one”), I forced myself to get out of the house and my comfort zone, more often than I wanted. And guess what? It was much easier than I expected. I found it fun and exciting to meet new people, and after doing this for just over a few months, I’ve gone on more dates than in any other year of my life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So yeah. This year was pretty great for dating (and also learning about myself). And that’s what this blog post is about: how learning about myself through all these experiences gave me some insight into the kind of person I am—and what kind of person I want to be with for the rest of my life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Travelling to new countries has been one of my favourite parts of the past year. I’ve been to Hungary, Lithuania, and a few other cities in Germany so far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I visited Lithuania for work, and it was such an incredible experience. The country itself is beautiful—the people are so friendly, the food is delicious (and cheap!), and there’s a lot of history to explore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best part was that I got to meet some amazing colleagues while I was there—who showed us around Vilnius, the capital and took us on some really cool city tours in Kaunus. I learnt, just like the Germans, Lithuanians also like to drink beer with their meals (and sometimes without), and you can buy vodka flavoured with anything from chocolate to potato to Cranberry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hungary was my second country this year where I vacationed with an old colleague turned friend, back from my time in India. It was so great getting to see him again and explore the city of Budapest together! We had a great time exploring all kinds of beer cafes, caves, warm baths, restaurants and ruin bars… basically everything!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve always loved making videos, but I never felt like I could make anything worthwhile. I was always afraid someone would watch one of my videos and not like it, and then what? Would they think I’m a failure? Would they judge me? What if they’re right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I kept telling myself that there was so much content out there already—why should anyone watch my videos? It didn’t matter what kind of content they were. There was too much competition, and no one would care about what I had to say.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But then something changed. I realized that if only one person watches one of my videos and finds it useful, then it’s worth it for me to keep going. So now, instead of worrying about whether anyone will watch my videos or not — and whether or not they’ll like them — I’ve decided to just focus on getting them out there into the world. And so far, it’s working!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I let go of my concerns about what content would work best and publish something I’m already comfortable with, programming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I bought a cheap light off Ebay so that people wouldn’t see me as squinting into the camera, and started recording videos on my cellphone. I also started learning some video editing basics, and after a few months now, I have 60+ subscribers and five videos on my channel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s a huge improvement from zero!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s where I encourage you to check out my YouTube channel. If you like the blog, chances are good that you’ll enjoy watching me talk about tech and build fun things together!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s been a crazy year, but I’m ready to move on to the next. The big question is: what will this new year bring? Well, I think I know the answer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ll start with some good news: it’ll be a clean slate! No more looking back at all of the amazing things we did in 2022—we’re just going to be looking ahead to what’s next. And what’s next is a whole bunch of exciting new things!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I learned a lot this year, but the most important thing I took away is that you don’t need to wait for a new year to make a change. You can start planning your goals quarterly and then retrospect on your progress every quarter or month, just like you would for any important goals at your office. This will help keep you accountable and motivated through the hard parts of the setting, reaching, and surpassing goals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m looking forward to 2023 with a smile on my face because I know what my priorities are now: family first, friends second, and me third. And if that means I have to put myself last sometimes (which I do), then so be it!&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[I moved to Europe for a tech job, mid pandemic]]></title><description><![CDATA[Does it make sense to leave a stable job with good pay, friends and families and an almost perfect life to start everything afresh from complete zero in a foreign land?]]></description><link>https://v3.siwalik.in/posts/moving-europe-tech-job</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://v3.siwalik.in/posts/moving-europe-tech-job</guid><pubDate>Mon, 22 Aug 2022 20:08:55 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;I moved from India to Europe around one year back for a new job.

&lt;p&gt;For some years now, every December, I would write in my Vision and Values journal about how I would want the next year to be and the best things that can happen for my career, well-being etc. For 2021, among others, I had a point about relocating outside India for a tech job and exploring new cultures. At least if not move, give my best shot at it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Around March last year, it was officially one year since I permanently moved back to my parent’s house (thanks to Covid). Arguably it was the best bonding time I had with them in years, and my heart was whole.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But also, I started looking for a job change as I felt overworked at my current work and wanted more challenges and exposure in my career. So I started applying to smaller Indian startups for practice as my interviewing skills were rusty. After attending many interviews for a month, it felt like the right time to apply for jobs abroad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-germany-or-even-europe&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#why-germany-or-even-europe&quot; aria-label=&quot;why germany or even europe permalink&quot; class=&quot;anchor before&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; focusable=&quot;false&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Why Germany or even Europe?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After much research, I was sure I wanted to explore Europe. For me EU seemed more lucrative than my second preference, US as Europe seemed to score better in what I was looking for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To name a few,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Europe is known for better work-life balance&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Health care was almost free in Europe compared to the States&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Getting residence options for expats were more flexible in EU&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Moving to an EU country would be a travel pass to the whole Europe&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was mainly interested in western European countries (except the UK, yeah due to Brexit). So I started looking at tech companies mainly in Germany, Netherlands and France in that order.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After few months of interviewing actively, I ended up with two offers in Germany. I decided to drop all other ongoing interviews in favour of one of the German offers as I vibed greatly with their company culture and energy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were a few more reasons which helped me choose Germany despite knowing you need to learn a new language to survive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The position I chose was in Berlin. Berlin, the most racially and culturally diverse city in Germany(if not EU), had a significant English-speaking population. Moreover, learning german wasn’t a criterion as the primary work language in tech would still be English.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The history, the art and the hipster vibe of Berlin seemed very, very palatable to my taste.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Germany has one of the best health and taxpayer benefits in Europe, smoother PR options, an ever-growing tech industry with most FAANG companies, and so many world-class tech startups.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before moving, I was clear about the best and worst-case scenarios. As people say, the grass is always greener on the other side; Germany looked like a vast green flag for this new chapter. But what if it was not?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes I wondered if I find it difficult to adjust in Germany or if the company wasn’t a right fit.
I knew I was just one flight and at-max a few months of job search away from moving back and finding some work in India to be able to pay my bills. Reframing my thoughts and establishing a safety net or plan B helped me feel calm with anxieties and enjoy the migration process more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking back a year later, I feel I could have missed out on so much life experience and learning if I had given in to the demons in my head. The ones who tell you maybe you’re not prepared or not good enough to take such a giant leap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I could go back in time, 10/10, I’ll retake the same chances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It has been a roller coaster ride so far, but luckily, there are more ups than downs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most European countries are very particular about work-life balance, which means you’re done with your 8 hours of work by 5 pm and have the rest of the evening to yourself. That leaves you with ample time for yourself to be with friends, indulge in hobbies or maybe sit in the park and look at the river.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ll be honest, this experience has been like fresh air to me. Having enough time for myself let me be in better mental space and health. In the past months, I took a long break from social media and spent more times outdoors. Germany has beautiful parks, lakes and hiking trails where I’ll often spend my lazy weekends. In other days, I would explore the city, or try out some cafes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inside my tiny studio, I started learning how to grow plants and not kill them for once. I also started a Twitch channel where I stream live coding sessions from time to time for fun. Also in this short span I visited two wonderful countries, Hungary and Lithuania.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just in the last 12 months I realised I had read more books, walked more steps and played more hours of guitar than maybe the last decade, back home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;bendmorris on Nov 9, 2016 @ HN | A man was walking along a river bank when he saw another man on the opposite side. “Hello!” he called out, “how do you get to the other side of the river?” The man called out in response, “you are on the other side of the river!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back in India, I had already stayed away from my hometown for university and job for nearly eight years. And being a decent cook and organised person(well, messy desks don’t count), living solo as an expat was one of my most minor concerns. But I discounted the fact that you’re in a country now and it can get pretty lonely sometimes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Making friends as an adult is already hard. More so in Germany, as people are very private and respect their and others’ personal spaces, making it a bit overwhelming for random talks and reaching out to someone new.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes when I go out for a walk or to the supermarket to grab some groceries, I would look around and get this alienated feeling, and all the good stuff would fade away in a moment. But then again, I learnt this was pretty normal as we are social animals, and we long for nothing more than our herd. Which I didn’t have at that moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the first few months, this started getting better. I joined some community of expats and got to meet some great people from Reddit groups like r/berlinsocialclub and on telegram. Absorbing a new culture, history and tradition can take years, so &lt;i&gt;taking it easy&lt;/i&gt; is the only way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;gratitude&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#gratitude&quot; aria-label=&quot;gratitude permalink&quot; class=&quot;anchor before&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; focusable=&quot;false&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Gratitude&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know for someone who has already done something, it’s always easy to say, “well, that was very easy”. But a lot of things played a crucial part in this journey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, my university degree allowed me to apply to many jobs, which was a primary criterion for getting an EU BlueCard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m looking at you, people of Twitter with hot takes like “don’t go to college for a tech job”. Well, if you are from a third-world country like me, going to college or not might be the thin line between getting a US/UE Visa or not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, all the exposures I had from the previous high-pressure jobs I’ve complained about above gave me a lot of learning (and maybe reasons) which helped me prepare for this move.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last but not the least, I feel very fortunate and grateful to be able to connect all the dots in my life so far, to travel half way around the world and live the kind of life I could only dream of a year back. ✨&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;

And the last thing you want to happen is to forget what you studied after a while, especially if the contents weren’t just a fantasy novel but some technical topics you’ve studied perhaps for an upcoming interview or improving your skills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the past few years, I’ve experimented with a bunch of study techniques and in this post, I talk about everything that worked great for me. I’ve tried to condense all of my learnings into some techniques below, hope you find this useful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you want to learn something, problem exploration is possibly the most important thing to start with. You might have heard many first-time founders of startups trying to first build a solution and then try to find the market suitable for their product, which almost never works out, do they? Just like market research is important in this case, before jumping into how something works, we should gain a deeper understanding of the problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, If we take a programming concept like currying, the internet is filled with articles on how to write a currying function in every language possible and multiple implementations too. But unless you get a deeper understanding of why we use currying and understand some real-life scenarios that are tricky to solve without using this concept, what you learned will eventually fade away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, before you can dive deep into a topic, spend some time first to understand a simpler abstraction of the problem. I often google a topic name followed by ELI5(short for Explain Like I’m 5) whenever I am studying a new concept. The internet is filled with so many great subreddits and StackOverflow answers which help you get a very atomic understanding of the concept before you can dig deep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A while back I decided to brush up my data structure basics and instead of directly jumping into Leetcode problems, I used a coding podcast (BaseCS podcast) as my ELI5. It gave me a much-needed foundation for going deep into the topics later on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spaced repetition is an evidence-backed study technique that uses a ‘spacing effect’, to form long-lasting memories. If you’re new to this term, here is how Wikipedia defines it -&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spaced repetition is a method where the subject is asked to remember a certain fact with the time intervals increasing each time the fact is
presented or said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most popular way to practice spaced repetition is with flashcards. There are many systems to use flashcards effectively but my favourite one and the most efficient way of using flashcards is using the Leitner System.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s how it works - you create 5 boxes where each box corresponds to a time delay after which it shall be revisited. All your flashcards start at box one. After the box’s given time interval elapses, each card you recollect correctly goes to the next box and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But at any level, if you fail to remember a card, it goes all the way back to box one. That way you spend more time on concepts which are harder to grasp and less time on things you got easily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Forgetting your flash-cards even after studying a lot, is very normal and don’t feel bad if that happens to you. In fact some forgetting is necessary to strengthen our learning when revisiting that topic later to form a lasting memory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the Feynman technique (named after famous physicist and Nobel laureate Richard Feynman), once you’ve studied something, try teaching that to someone who is inexperienced in that topic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the process, you’ll notice the gaps in your learning, go back to learn those. Try teaching again and repeat the cycle until you can explain that concept clearly to someone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you don’t have a student, try to write your explanation online as it might serve as an ELI5 for someone else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most popular one and something which you might already know is learning by practice. Our mind often overestimates our thinking and recalling abilities when we read something. Hence we tend to tell ourselves things like “Nah, I get how this example works! No need to write it down, I’ll remember.” Don’t lie to yourself. Take out that notepad and make notes as your study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re learning something which involves a paradigm shift like a new framework or language, typing out everything as I learn has proved to be my #1 go-to method these days. It’s really beneficial to write down/type things up as it also helps develop a muscle memory over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;selectively-forgetting&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#selectively-forgetting&quot; aria-label=&quot;selectively forgetting permalink&quot; class=&quot;anchor before&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; focusable=&quot;false&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Selectively Forgetting&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With information being available just a Google search away these days do we really need to remember everything? If not, how do you decide what to remember and what to forget?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A rule of thumb I follow is to not spend much time memorising things which are very easy to look up. As long as you can remember the topic briefly and remember that it is available on Google, we’re good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are things I almost always lookup like browser APIs, the difference between slice and splice or regex patterns to name a few and feel we don’t need to be &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrDAuU8Blhc&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Bradly Cooper from Limitless&lt;/a&gt; and try to remember everything. Our brains hold limited information so reserve it for more important things and always look for what trivial piece of the puzzle you can not learn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are some of my favourite techniques, and some work better over the others for learning different kind of things. Play around and see what works for you best.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, be mindful when you look up information on the internet as it often contains backdated or wrong answers. So referring multiple sources works great.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since my very first interaction with a computer, blog posts have been everything to my learning. Along the way, I had published a few blog posts myself. I created and maintained a tech-blog back in the day when Blogspot was a thing. But despite all that experience, I was spoiled for choice when I saw down to build a blog for myself last year. I was completely lost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I grew up looking at incredible and often unbelievable web-designs on awwwards.com (which in a way inspired me to pick up frontend), so when it came to my blog, I wanted it to stand out in all possible ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;chasing-rainbows&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#chasing-rainbows&quot; aria-label=&quot;chasing rainbows permalink&quot; class=&quot;anchor before&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; focusable=&quot;false&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Chasing Rainbows&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I knew I wanted to build something outstanding—something that would make my readers go “wow”. In all honesty, I want to show off my tech skills as someone who has been a frontend engineer for quite some time . Duh! So I went to my journal and started figuring out my secret herbs and spices.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;/picture&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few months later, I had a blog that was still no way near completion. To top that, now and then I would see something beautiful online and come back to my drawing board and re-iterate on my blog in terms of tech and UI, thanks to my monkey mind. Clearly, I didn’t know what to prioritise and soon enough I started procrastinating and pushing this project for later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;finding-the-purpose&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#finding-the-purpose&quot; aria-label=&quot;finding the purpose permalink&quot; class=&quot;anchor before&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; focusable=&quot;false&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Finding the Purpose&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then a couple of weeks later I sat down one evening to retrospect things not going on as planned in my life (I try to do this a few times every month). And it suddenly struck me. I thought about why I wanted to create a blog in the first place and what is that I’m doing wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have always wanted to document my tech journey and learn in public and share it as I grow. But somewhere along the line, I completely forgot about the purpose and focussed on the not so important things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-theme=&quot;dark&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;It&amp;#39;s blowing my mind that people care more about the tech stack of their blog than the actual content of it.&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Kitze (@thekitze) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/thekitze/status/1168929106613997569?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;September 3, 2019&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’ve ever told yourself you’ll start that podcast once you have that mic or finally start running once you buy a running shoe, I was at that exact place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, the next weekend I decided to completely scrap the website I spent months on, fork a minimal open source project from Github and start freaking writing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Make it work, then make it better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As this saying goes, I plan to incrementally tweak things over time and still focus on spending most of the time on the content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#conclusion&quot; aria-label=&quot;conclusion permalink&quot; class=&quot;anchor before&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; focusable=&quot;false&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t know if a perfect tech blog exists. But If it does, it must be its contents. Ego is the enemy folks! Let go of your inhibitions and focus on shipping the smallest chunk of work which will provide value to your target audience. That’s it.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I used to freelance as a full stack developer during my college, often I would find myself stuck between context switching in terms of practices and different syntaxes in javascript and php. Although I was making some good side cash and had a bunch of happy clients, the code I was writing was not great as it seemed tough to expertise on every aspect of web development at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being a hardcore JS fan and ardent lover of interfaces, I decided to focus solely on frontend and after freelancing for a few more months, I join a startup as a frontend developer. I was content with my learnings and adventures in the frontend land… until I came across this yesterday ~&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The roles required to design and develop a web solution require a deep
skill set and vast experience in the area of visual design, UI/interaction design, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/kamranahmedse/developer-roadmap#-front-end-roadmap&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;front-end development&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/kamranahmedse/developer-roadmap#-back-end-roadmap&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;back-end development&lt;/a&gt;.
Any person who can fill one or more of these 4 roles at a professional
level is an extremely rare commodity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, given that JavaScript has infiltrated all layers of a
technology stack (e.g. React, node.js, express, couchDB, gulp.js
etc…) finding a full-stack JS developer who can code the front-end
and back-end is becoming less mythical. -&lt;a href=&quot;https://frontendmasters.com/books/front-end-handbook/2018/practice/myth.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Frontend Handbook
‘18&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I started wondering, why not? I already know frontend, I also manage to write some (crappy but) working backend code in php for my side projects, why not harness my javascript knowledge and become a full stack javascript developer, just by connecting the dots and a bit of learning?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it comes to learning, the reason majority of our plans fail is because &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;we don’t often have an action plan&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. And any resolution or goal without a proper plan is bound to fail! So I started there, with the planning.
[fun fact: that’s the same reason why our new year resolution’s fail!]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spent the next day researching on topics and resources one needs to learn in course of this journey to be a full stack developer just by harnessing the superpowers of Javascript. So I created a to-do list which starts at the very basics of javascript and build its way up to the more advance concepts, covering all the tech stacks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/YgBfkWW.png&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot from notes app&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re a front-end developer looking forward to &lt;em&gt;up your game&lt;/em&gt; or maybe you’re already a full-stack developer and want to brush up your skills for an interview or for your next side project, I’m certain, this will be helpful to you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I posted the list on Github which you can &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/siwalikm/Prep-for-Full-Stack-JS&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;check it out here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to stay motivated and track your progress, fork my todo list from Github and commit to your repo with crossed out items, as you progress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-bash&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;git&lt;/span&gt; clone https://github.com/siwalikm/Prep-for-Full-Stack-JS.git&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;P.S. Remember: The key is to stay motivated.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If possible, start learning along with a friend and maybe build something together along the process. If you’re learning alone, reach out to people if you get stuck and try to document your learnings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Share this post with your friends if you think they’ll find it helpful.

&lt;p&gt;In this article we will learn the fundamentals of a JWT token is and how we can benefit from it for authenticating communications between two parties, all of this using vanilla NodeJS and javascript.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JWT is an abbreviation for JSON Web Token, which is a compact URL-safe means of representing claims to be transferred between two parties. The claims in a JWT are encoded as a JSON object that is digitally signed using JSON Web Signature (JWS). ~ IETF&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Urggh! What?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simply put, JWT token is a string we pass in the header or url while making a network request to pass data safely and make sure it hasn’t been tampered with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Example: www.example.com/private/?token=xxxxx.yyyyy.zzzzz&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You might be wondering what’s with the token format! JWT tokens consists of three parts separated by dots &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;( . )&lt;/code&gt; which are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;header.payload.signature&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s see the differents parts of a JWT token in details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Header&lt;/strong&gt;
The header typically consists of two parts: the type of the token, which is JWT, and the hashing algorithm being used, such as HMAC SHA256 or RSA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
   &lt;span class=&quot;token string-property property&quot;&gt;&quot;alg&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;HS256&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
   &lt;span class=&quot;token string-property property&quot;&gt;&quot;typ&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;JWT&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, this JSON is Base64Url encoded to form the first part of the JWT.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;use strict&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; header &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;alg&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;HS256&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;typ&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;JWT&apos;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; enc_header &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; Buffer&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token constant&quot;&gt;JSON&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;stringify&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;header&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;toString&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;base64&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// ► &quot;eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Payload&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second part of the token is the payload, which contains the &lt;strong&gt;claims&lt;/strong&gt;. Claims are predefined keys and their values. There are three types of claims: registered, public, and private claims.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Registered claims:&lt;/strong&gt; These are a set of predefined keys which are not mandatory but recommended. Some of them are &lt;strong&gt;iss&lt;/strong&gt; (issuer), &lt;strong&gt;exp&lt;/strong&gt; (expiration time) etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Public claims:&lt;/strong&gt; These can be defined at will by those using JWTs. But to avoid collisions they should be defined in the IANA JSON Web Token Registry or be defined as a URI that contains a collision resistant namespace.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Private claims:&lt;/strong&gt; These are the custom key value pairs created to share information between parties that agree on using them and are neither registered or public claims.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
   &lt;span class=&quot;token string-property property&quot;&gt;&quot;exp&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;2019-02-14&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
   &lt;span class=&quot;token string-property property&quot;&gt;&quot;message&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;roses are red&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The payload is then Base64Url encoded to form the second part of the JSON Web Token.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;use strict&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; payload &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;exp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;2019-02-14&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;message&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;roses are red&apos;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; enc_payload &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; Buffer&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token constant&quot;&gt;JSON&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;stringify&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;payload&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;toString&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;base64&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// ► eyJleHAiOiIyMDE5LTAyLTE0IiwibmFtZSI6IkpvaG4gRG9lIn0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Signature&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To create the signature part you have to take the encoded header, the encoded payload, a secret, the algorithm specified in the header, and sign that. Too good for us that NodeJS comes with the immensely powerful &lt;a href=&quot;https://nodejs.org/api/crypto.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Crypto library&lt;/a&gt; out of the box which we will use in our example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;use strict&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; crypto &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;require&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;crypto&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; jwt_secret &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;secret&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// enc_header and enc_payload are computed earlier&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; signature &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; crypto
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;createHmac&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;sha256&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; jwt_secret&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;update&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;enc_header &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;.&apos;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; enc_payload&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;digest&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;base64&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// ► 6C46KAaZGp6RjbSqGllfdQF7g8vXCp02NTSrz-PzeoI&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The signature is used to verify that the sender of the JWT is who it says it is and to ensure that the message wasn’t changed along the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final JWT token looks like this&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; token &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token template-string&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token template-punctuation string&quot;&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token interpolation&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token interpolation-punctuation punctuation&quot;&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;enc_header&lt;span class=&quot;token interpolation-punctuation punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token interpolation&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token interpolation-punctuation punctuation&quot;&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;enc_payload&lt;span class=&quot;token interpolation-punctuation punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token interpolation&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token interpolation-punctuation punctuation&quot;&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;signature&lt;span class=&quot;token interpolation-punctuation punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token template-punctuation string&quot;&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// ► eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJleHAiOiIyMDE5LTAyLTE0IiwibWVzc2FnZSI6InJvc2VzIGFyZSByZWQifQ.0u-mkgLo5479CPjJJ4mXCwn2RW4dFT12fiYiopRWsZw&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Something important to remember here is that JWT tokens are used for authentication and not encryption, so even without knowing the secret key, someone can read your header and payload data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But upon receiving the token you can sign the header and payload again with your secret key and compare it with the received signature to detect tampering of token or the message.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A good place to start will be by going to this &lt;a href=&quot;https://jwt.io/#debugger&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;online JWT debugger at jwt.io&lt;/a&gt; and play around with the the token we just generated above.&lt;/p&gt;
